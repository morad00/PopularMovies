Android developer nanodegree: Project 1 (Stage 1&amp;2)

A fully functional and colorful android app which I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program in Udacity. This app reveals the power of adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices.


# Features
- Discover the most popular or the highest rated movies
- Displayes details about movies (ratings, release date, reviews)
- Shows videos related to movies (trailers)


# How to use 
The app uses [IMDB Movie API] (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to retrieve movies up-to-date, So you need to put your own API key in `app/gradle.properties` to build this app
